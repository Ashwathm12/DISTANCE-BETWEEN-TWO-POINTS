# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
start the program
### Step 2: 
Get the input value as l1,l2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4:
print the required output
### Step 5: 
End of the program
### PROGRAM:
  ```

import math
l2=[10,6]
l1=[4,2]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
  ```


### OUTPUT:
